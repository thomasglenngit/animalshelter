  <h2>Helter-skelter Animal Shelter!</h2>

  <h3>Welcome to Helter-Skelter!</h3>
    
    <p>We care about pets. We're a little messy because we have so many pets that need love. But that's where you come in.
    </p>
      
    </p>Many people purchase pets without realizing the commitment, love and dedication that it requires to care for these precious creatures. After the "cute" phase, these pets become "nuissances" to many people. The humane way to deal with them is to bring them to an anmial shelter. And so we care for these neglected souls 24/7.
    </p>

    <p>But we need your help! If you are a caring person who possesses the commitment and compassion to care for a pet LONG-TERM, we would love to introduce you to your new love-of-your-life.
    </p>

    <p>Below is a list of pets that urgently need new owners. Please take time to read about each one, then click on the link to fill out your form and send it back to us to reserve that pet. (Limit 2 per customer.)

    <p>This is Tiki. She has the loudest purr. She came to us as a forlorn street cat. But she loves the bath and playing with yarn.
